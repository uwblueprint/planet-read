You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  C:\Users\Andrew Guo\OneDrive - University of Waterloo (1)\Blueprint\planet-read

Before we get started, keep in mind:

  * You are initializing in an existing Firebase project directory

? Are you ready to proceed? Yes

=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

i  .firebaserc already has a default project, using planet-read-uwbp.
